# conference-website

The web site for the Open edX Conferences.

The current page is in index.html.  Previous years are in subdirectories named
for the year.  Assets for previous years are moved into those subdirectories to
avoid relying on assets that might change in the current year.

Sponsor logos are kept in images/sponsors and shared across years because they
get used for multiple years.  When adding sponsors, don't change the image at
an existing file name.
